THE BASIC IT SKILLS ARE OPERATING SYSTEM,NETWOTK SKILLS,SECURITY SKILLS,CLOUD SKILLS AND ALSO PROGRAMMING SKILLS.
AN OPERATING SYSTEM IS A SYSTEM SOFTWARE THAT MANGAGES THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE RESOURCES AND PROVIDES COMMON SERVICES FOR COMPUTER PROGRAMS
THE FRIST OPERATING SYSTEM WAS DEVELPOED IN THE YEAR 1956 BY GENERAL MOTORS TO RUN A SINGLE IBM COMPUTERS.IT WAS IN THE 1960'S THE IBM HAD STARTED INSTALLING OS IN THE DEVICES THEY LAUNCHED
THE FIRST VERSION OF THE UNIX OPERATING YSTEM WAS LAUNCHED IN THE 1960'S AND WAS WRITTEN IN PROGRAMMING C LANGUAGE.

TYPES OF OPERATING SYSTEM
1.BATCH OPERATING SYSTEM
2.REAL-TIME OPERAATING SYSTEM
3.TIME SHARING OPERATING SYSTEM
4.DISTRIBUTED OPERATING SYSTEM
5.EMBEDDED OPERATING SYSTEM
6.NETWORK OPERATING SYSTEM
7.MOBILE OPERATING SYSTEM



1. Batch Operating System
There is no direct communication between the computer and the OS
There is an intermediate, the Operator, which needs to distribute the work into batches and sort similar jobs
Multiple users can use it
Can easily manager a large amount of work

2. Real-Time Operating System
It has a data processing system
The processing time is very small between the userâ€™s command and the output
Used in fields where the response needs to be quick and rapid

3. Time-Sharing Operating System
Multiple people at various terminals can use a program at the same time 
The main motive is to minimize the response time

4. Distributed Operating System
When two or more systems are connected to each other and one can open files which are not present in their system but in other devices connected in the network
Its usage has now increased over the years
They use multiple central processors to serve real-time applications
Failure of one system does not affect the other systems connected in the network

5. Embedded Operating System
These special Operating systems are built into larger systems
They generally are limited to single specific functions like an ATM

6. Network Operating System
They have one main server which is connected to other client servers
All the management of files, processing of data, access to sharing files, etc. are performed over this small network
It is also a secure operating system for working with multiple users

7. Mobile Operating System
With the advancement in the field of technology, smartphones now are released with an Operating system. 
They are designed in a manner that they can help a small device work efficiently

FUNCTIONS OF AN OPERATING SYSTEM
-IT HELPS IN MANAGING COMPUTER RESOURCES.
-IT IS A SERVICE PROVIDER
-IT IS USED TO DETECT BUGS OR ERRORS
-IT IS USED TO RUN ANY KIND OF PROGRAM
-IT COORDINATES THE SOFTWARE AND ITS USER
